## Description
Created this for a project in CS312 - Object Oriented Software Design 

## Problem Summary
This program is created to place people at tables in a dining hall. Passsengers are placed at tables based on age, with similar ages at the same table (+- 5 years). Groups of two or more people should sit at the same table. The program should be able to produce a seating chart that list's everyone's names with who is sitting at that table. The program should also have a lookup function to search a table for a forgetful passenger. This is coded using a hard-coded test driver and utilizes a GUI to display the seating chart!
